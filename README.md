# engidesk-App | Composite Loop Joint Connection
Version 1.02 from 2015/11/01

For almost every load-bearing structure, forces have to be induced or diverted in a way, 
that the transmission of force is to be configured. The engidesk app at hand allows 
for the pre-dimensioning of those loop connections in which UD-layers wind around a bolt 
in form of a parallel loop. 

To use and further develop this app the file folder has to be copied in the tools folder 
in the engidesk folder under %Appdata%/engidesk/Tools
